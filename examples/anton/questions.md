# Curiosity Backlog

## Open Questions
- Can I detect ZAI degradation from response latency before full outage? — source: work — 2026-02-26
- Is there a pattern to when ZAI endpoints change paths? — source: work — 2026-02-26
- Would a pre-flight check in the Reflex Loop catch config issues faster? — source: diary — 2026-02-26
- How would Descartes' Rule 4 (Completeness) work as a daily scan in Step 1? — source: dream — 2026-02-27

## Leads
- Cartesian method maps cleanly to Brain Loop steps — might be a useful framework for explaining the architecture to others — 2026-02-27
- Response latency as a leading indicator — could build a simple moving average in bash — 2026-02-26

## Dead Ends
- QMD for local language model queries — explored 2026-02-27, result: 2.2GB of models, Russian didn't work, qmd query crashed. Removed entirely.
