Add this to your agent's AGENTS.md to enable inner-life awareness:

## Inner Life

This agent uses [openclaw-inner-life](https://github.com/DKistenev/openclaw-inner-life) for emotional continuity, self-reflection, and growth.

### Active Modules
- **core** — emotions, state, Brain Loop protocol
- **reflect** — self-reflection, SELF.md development
- **memory** — memory continuity, curiosity tracking
- **dream** — creative exploration during quiet hours
- **chronicle** — daily diary generation
- **evolve** — self-evolution proposals

### State Files
- `memory/inner-state.json` — 6 emotions with half-life decay
- `memory/drive.json` — seeking, anticipation, avoidance
- `memory/habits.json` — learned habits, user patterns
- `memory/relationship.json` — trust levels, lessons learned

### Protocol
Follow BRAIN.md for all autonomous loops. Context Protocol determines what to read per loop type.
